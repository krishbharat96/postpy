# postpy
This an easy-to-use module that extracts table information directly from PostgreSQL dump files and extracts the tables as pandas dataframes. The information within the dataframes are also queryable using some functions that are found within the module. This has been designed for the SPOKE medical knowledge network (look at krishbharat96/SPOKE, and RBVI/SPOKE) in order to easily auto-update the data within SPOKE utilizing publicly available resources that sometimes appear as PostgreSQL files. In addition to the postpy.py module, there is also a postpy_drugcentral.py module for parsing the DrugCentral Postgres database (since there are molecular structures within that database which are "parsed out" through this module, since they would be problematic to store within a pandas dataframe). The Python Pandas package is required for this module.
